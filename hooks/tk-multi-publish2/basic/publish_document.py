    Plugin for publishing an after effects project.

        Publishes the project file to Shotgun. A <b>Publish</b> entry will be
        created in Shotgun which will include a reference to the file's current
        path on disk. Other users will be able to access the published file via
        the <b><a href='%s'>Loader</a></b> so long as they have access to
        the file's location on disk.

        If the project has not been saved, validation will fail and a button
        will be provided in the logging output to save the file.

        <h3>File versioning</h3>
        If the filename contains a version number, the process will bump the
        file to the next version after publishing.

        The <code>version</code> field of the resulting <b>Publish</b> in
        Shotgun will also reflect the version number identified in the filename.
        The basic worklfow recognizes the following version formats by default:

        <ul>
        <li><code>filename.v###.ext</code></li>
        <li><code>filename_v###.ext</code></li>
        <li><code>filename-v###.ext</code></li>
        </ul>

        After publishing, if a version number is detected in the file, the file
        will automatically be saved to the next incremental version number.
        For example, <code>filename.v001.ext</code> will be published and copied
        to <code>filename.v002.ext</code>

        If the next incremental version of the file already exists on disk, the
        validation step will produce a warning, and a button will be provided in
        the logging output which will allow saving the project to the next
        available version number prior to publishing.

        <br><br><i>NOTE: any amount of version number padding is supported.</i>

        <h3>Overwriting an existing publish</h3>
        A file can be published multiple times however only the most recent
        publish will be available to other users. Warnings will be provided
        during validation if there are previous publishes.
